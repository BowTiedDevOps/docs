# Argon

After Neon, Argon is the next public testnet slated to be released at the beginning of March. While Neon was great for demonstrating the capability of fast blocks, Argon will be much more feature complete and is meant to be a testnet for the full-on Nakamoto hard fork coming in April.

Here are some things you can expect with Argon:

* Nakamoto performance gains with existing Clarity WASM
* All Nakamoto rules in place
* POX-4, Throughput gains, Lower Latency, Existing Clarity WASM
* Clarity WASM to feature complete with full Clarinet support
* Clarity WASM Performance benchmarking, improvements, & fuzzing
* Controlled testnet upgraded with performance gains
* Testing and audits on code complete components

Check back here after Argon is released for instructions for using the testnet and getting your applications migrated.
