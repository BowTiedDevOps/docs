# Testnets

There are two testnet releases of Nakamoto for developers to experiment with: Neon and Argon.

Neon is a controlled testnet (only a single block producer) designed to get the minimum functionality of Nakamoto running for people to experiment with.

Argon is a much more fully-featured testnet release that will allow developers and users to test out Nakamoto functionality much more like what the final release will be.
