# Pre-Launch Testnet

**Primary Usage:** Core Developers, (some) App Developers

**About:**

* This testnet will exist until the Nakamoto launch is complete and features an accelerated Stacking cycle length of 2 days so that core devs and builders can simulate a lot of blockchain history (and PoX cycles) in a short time.
* This testnet can run against Bitcoin Regtest or Bitcoin Testnet
* Given ongoing audits and testing, this testnet may have bugs, be reset, or run into occasional performance issues as tweaks are made.

**Status:** This is testnet currently live, stable, and producing blocks.\
\
**Next:** The Pre-Launch testnet is set to move to [Step 2 (Activation)](../nakamoto-rollout-plan.md) on March 11th, meaning at that point it will be a complete testnet representation of the network with the Nakamoto rules live (except of course that it moves through blocks much faster).
